PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS="System - Akeeba Passwordless Login"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_DESCRIPTION="Enables passwordless authentication using the W3C Web Authentication (Webauthn) API. Your users can log in using U2F Security Keys, FIDO2 hardware keys or hardware-managed credentials on their device."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_ATTESTATION_SUPPORT_DESC="Only allow authenticators with verifiable cryptographic signatures to be used for WebAuthn logins. Strongly recommended for high security environments. Requires your site to be able to access <code>https://mds.fidoalliance.org/</code> directly, a writeable cache directory, the system temporary directory being writeable by PHP, and the OpenSSL extension. May prevent some cheaper, non-certified authenticators from working at all. Disabling it also prevents Joomla from identifying the make and model of the authenticator you are using (no icon will be displayed next to the Authenticator Name).<br/><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you are behind a firewall you can place the data downloaded from <a href='https://mds.fidoalliance.org/' target='_blank'>the FIDO Alliance</a> into the file <code>administrator/cache/fido.jwt</code> for this feature to work properly."
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_ATTESTATION_SUPPORT_LABEL="Attestation support"

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_ALLOWRESIDENT_LABEL="Allow Passkeys"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_ALLOWRESIDENT_DESC="Should the user be allowed to register and use Passkeys? Passkeys are authenticator credentials with attached user information stored on the user's authenticator device. They allow the user to log into the site without using a username and password (as opposed to having to type their username). The downside is that most hardware authenticators can only store a limited number of passkeys â€” typically just 5 to 20. On the other hand, built-in authenticators like Windows Hello and Apple Passkeys on iCloud Keychain have no storage limit and offer a much better user experience. Note: Disabling this option will reject any login attempt without a username and password."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_LOGIN_LABEL="Passwordless Login"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_LOGIN_DESC="Login without a password using the W3C Web Authentication standard. You need to have already set up passwordless authentication in your user profile."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_HEADER="Passwordless Login"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_LABEL="W3C Web Authentication Passwordless Login"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_DESC="Lets you manage passwordless login methods using the W3C Web Authentication standard. You need a supported browser and authenticator (e.g. Google Chrome and a FIDO2 certified security key)."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_MANAGE_BTN_ADD_TIP="<strong>Authenticator credentials require you to type your username to log into the site with passwordless authentication.</strong><br/><br/>If unsure, use this type of authenticator.<br/><br/>Authenticator credentials do not use any of the limited Passkey storage of your hardware authenticator. You can link an unlimited number of sites to each Authenticator using authenticator credentials."
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_MANAGE_BTN_ADDRESIDENT_LABEL="Add new Passkey"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_MANAGE_BTN_ADDRESIDENT_TIP="<strong>You can log in with Passkeys without having to type in your username.</strong><br/></br/>However, they are stored in your Authenticator's memory. Hardware Authenticators have a limited storage for passkeys, typically for only 5 to 10 sites. Built-in authenticators such as Windows Hello, Apple's TouchID/FaceID and Android biometrics don't have a storage limit. For this reason we recommend using Passkeys only with built-in authenticators."
