PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS="System - Akeeba Passwordless Login"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_DESCRIPTION="Allows users to log into the site with passkeys (no username or password needed) and WebAuthn authenticators (you need your username, but not a password)."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_ATTESTATION_SUPPORT_LABEL="Attestation support"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_ATTESTATION_SUPPORT_DESC="Only allow authenticators with verifiable cryptographic signatures to be used for WebAuthn logins. Strongly recommended for high security environments. Requires the OpenSSL extension. It may prevent some cheaper, non-certified authenticators from working at all. Disabling it also prevents Joomla! from identifying the make and model of the authenticator you are using (no icon will be displayed next to the Authenticator Name)."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_SHOWIMAGES_LABEL="Show images"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_SHOWIMAGES_DESC="Should I display the logo of the authenticator maker next to the authenticator name? The logo only works for authenticators added while the Attestation Support option is enabled. All other authenticators will display a generic FIDO logo."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_ALLOWRESIDENT_LABEL="Allow passkeys"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_ALLOWRESIDENT_DESC="Passkeys replace both username and password. They are synchronised across devices, and can function across platforms and Operating Systems (e.g. a passkey saved on an Android device can be used on a Mac computer)."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_JOOMLAWEBAUTHN_LABEL="Auto-migrate Joomla WebAuthn credentials"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_JOOMLAWEBAUTHN_DESC="Set to Yes and save the plugin to automatically migrate authenticators registered with Joomla's built-in ‘System - WebAuthn Passwordless Login’ plugin.<br/><strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</strong>: Set to Yes and click on Save. When the page reloads the option will appear again as No. <strong>This is normal and expected!</strong>. When you set to Yes and Save the plugin will do the following: move all entries from the WebAuthn plugin's storage (<code>#__webauthn_authenticators</code> database table) to the Passwordless plugin's storage (<code>#__passwordless_authenticators</code> database table); unpublish Joomla's WebAuthn; <em>reset this option back to No</em>."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_LABEL="Passkeys &amp; WebAuthn"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_DESC="Passkeys replace both username and password. Authenticators replace your password only."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_NOPASSWORD_LABEL="Password authentication"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_FIELD_NOPASSWORD_DESC="You can forbid logins to your account with a username and password when you have enabled login with passkey or authenticator. The option “Forbidden if I have two or more methods” will forbid username and password login only if you have two or more passkeys or authenticators set up in your user account. This is the safest option; it ensures you won't be locked out of this site."
