PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS="System - Akeeba Passwordless Login"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_DESCRIPTION="Enables passwordless authentication using the W3C Web Authentication (Webauthn) API. Your users can log in using U2F Security Keys, FIDO2 hardware keys or hardware-managed credentials on their device."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_CONFIG_REMEMBERUSER_LABEL="Allow one-click login"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_CONFIG_REMEMBERUSER_DESC="When enabled, it stores an encrypted user identifier in a cookie when the user logs in to the site. Next time the user visits the site on the same device and browser after their login session has expired they can click the Passwordless Login button without having to enter their username. This is secure; it does not leak information about the user (username, user ID or email) through the cookie. It is actually more secure than Joomla's Remember Me plugin since it requires the user to go through the Web Authentication ceremony to log back into the site."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_CONFIG_LOGINMODULES_LABEL="Frontend Login Modules' Names"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_CONFIG_LOGINMODULES_DESC="Enter the comma separated list of names of frontend modules. The passwordless login buttons will be appended to them automatically, e.g. <code>mod_login, mod_ajaxlogin</code>. Set this to <code>none</code> to prevent this behavior. In this case you must make template overrides according to the documentation."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_CONFIG_BACKENDLOGINMODULES_LABEL="Backend Login Modules' Names"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_CONFIG_BACKENDLOGINMODULES_DESC="Enter the comma separated list of names of backend modules. The passwordless login buttons will be appended to them automatically, e.g. <code>mod_login, mod_ajaxlogin</code>. Set this to <code>none</code> to prevent this behavior. In this case you must make template overrides according to the documentation."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_CONFIG_INTERCEPTLOGIN_LABEL="Add buttons to login page"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_CONFIG_INTERCEPTLOGIN_DESC="When enabled the plugin will automatically append the passwordless login buttons to the end of the login page created by Joomla's com_users. Otherwise you must make template overrides according to the documentation."

PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_CONFIG_RELOCATE_LABEL="Passwordless Login button placement"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_CONFIG_RELOCATE_OPT_NEXTTOLOGIN="Next to Login button"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_CONFIG_RELOCATE_OPT_ENDOFMODULE="End of module content"
PLG_SYSTEM_PASSWORDLESS_CONFIG_RELOCATE_DESC="The various Joomla login modules, including Joomla's own, do not offer a way to place additional buttons next to the Login button. If you use the 'Next to Login button' option Akeeba Passwordless Login will use Javascript to move its button next to what is <i>possibly</i> the Login action button of the module. If that fails, or if you use the 'End of module content' option, the Passwordless Login button will be placed at the end of the module's content."
